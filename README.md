# Breast_Cancer_Detector
Breast cancer detector using logistic regression

In this project I was able to classify the patients tumors so we can know if they are malignant or benign by using these parameters:

```
['Clump Thickness', 'Uniformity of Cell Size',
       'Uniformity of Cell Shape', 'Marginal Adhesion',
       'Single Epithelial Cell Size', 'Bare Nuclei', 'Bland Chromatin',
       'Normal Nucleoli', 'Mitoses']
```

The results were:

```
